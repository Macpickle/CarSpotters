# CarSpotters Fullstack Website
A fully developed website designed for car enthusiasts. 

### Website Function
This website was designed for a social space for car enthusiasts to interact, collaborate and share media between users. Users are able to create posts containing photos of cars they found, along with a location and whatever else information to be posted on the website. From then, users can find the post, or even search for it on a map to see the car, or find it for themselves in the real world.

This website is more of a proof of concept for me to understand the fullstack experience, this should not be used fully serious, as it could pose a security risk to the car owners.
