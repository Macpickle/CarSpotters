# CarSpotters Fullstack Website
This is an ongoing website being created by me, Macpickle, to help me learn more about web development.

### Website Idea
This website was created so that car enthusiasts could have a website dedicated to themselves to post about cars, event, news, etc... 

### Features
```
- Login, Registering and account management
- Post creation, Display, and infinite scroll post generation
- MongoDB Storage
- Secure loading
- Somewhat understanable front end design (still WIP)
```

### Features to be Added
```
- Comments on posts, liking and whatnot
- Maps to explore + search engine
- Messages, Notifications, Favouriting
- Account customization (profile picture, username change, etc)
- Events tab
- News tab
```

## Others
Feel free to make any comments on this, just realize this is all me learning new stuff.
